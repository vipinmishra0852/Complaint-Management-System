#Complaint Management System Project in Python

Simple Complaint Management System project is written in Python. The project file contains Python scripts (main.py, db.py, listComp.py). This is a simple console-based system that is very easy to use and understand. Talking about the system, it contains a very basic function which includes adding and viewing complaint lists. In this mini-project, there is no login feature. This means he/she can use these available features easily without any restrictions.

In this simple system, he/she can add/enter complaints about certain things easily. While complaining,  the user has to enter his/her full name, select gender, and write comments about any topic the user wants to. All the entered complaints are stored in a database and the user can easily view a list of complaints displaying the user’s name with their ID number, gender, and comments. This simple console-based Ticket Reservation system provides one of the simplest management of complaints. There is an external database connection in this mini project to save user’s data permanently and retrieve it.
